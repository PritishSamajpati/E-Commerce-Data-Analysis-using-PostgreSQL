## üöÄ Objectives

- Clean and prepare raw ecommerce data
- Import cleaned data into PostgreSQL
- Perform exploratory and advanced analysis
- Create views and indexes for performance
- Use SQL features like:
  - `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
  - `JOIN` operations (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`)
  - Subqueries and aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`)
  - Views and indexes
  - `LIKE` and `NULL` handling
  - Time-based and customer segmentation analysis

##Data Cleaning Using Excel--
1. *Missing values*:  
   - Description and CustomerID have missing entries.

2. *Date formatting*:  
   - InvoiceDate should be converted to proper datetime format.

3. *CustomerID type*:  
   - Should be converted to INTEGER if values are truly integers.

4. *Text cleanup*:  
   - Strip whitespace and possibly remove/control special characters.

5. *Duplicates*:  
   - Check for and remove exact duplicate rows.
